Eta: missing resources due to changes in the original website, which underwent a complete restyling.

### Project requirements:

Replicate at least three sections of the Fluentify website.

### Goals:

Get a hands-on understanding of what it takes to build a more complete page, bearing in mind the correct syntax, the use of comments and the general guidelines for writing clean code. Familiarize with more advanced CSS selectors.
